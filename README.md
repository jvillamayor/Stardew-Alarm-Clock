# Stardew-Alarm-Clock
Allows me to set an alarm clock which launches Stardew Valley. Any app(s) can be substituted in.

As is, the program is written to:

1. Set the computer to a medium volume.
2. Open Caffeine (a free app that prevents sleep, set it to activate upon starting): [http://lightheadsw.com/caffeine/](http://lightheadsw.com/caffeine/)
3. Sleep the display.
4. Wait until the current time is the set time.
5. Kill Caffeine.
6. Open the desired app.
